	<p style="margin: 0 100px 0 100px; font-size: 1.5em">Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
	some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
	output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
	input into the output.</p>
	<p>Because many programs use it as an intermediate step, sorting is a fundamental
	operation in computer science. As a result, we have a large number of good sorting
	algorithms at our disposal.</p>
